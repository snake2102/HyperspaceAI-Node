# Hyperspace Node
## ➡️ Method 1. Browser Node
* Run using browser if you have an idle PC or during the times you're working on your computer
* You might obtain uptime for multipliers, I'm running it 24/7
* You can run it on a windows server (if you have a VPS with windows installed on for other extension nodes)

### 1. Visit: https://node.hyper.space/

### 2. Switch the red button to green

* You receive points based on your node's uptime, liveness multiplier, and your system specification's tier
* You initially get Tier-5 but your tier and multiplier will increase over time as your node stays online with good performance

### 4. Save your *PrivateKey*
You can import it later
